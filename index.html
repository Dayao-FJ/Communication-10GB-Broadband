            <p>10G broadband network powered by the 50G Passive Optical Network (PON) technology, a fiber-optic standard that massively increases data transmission capabilities.</p>
            <p>The previous highest broadband speeds, typically delivered through top-tier fiber-optic connections, offered impressive performance. Real-world tests showed download speeds ranging from approximately 2,000 to 5,000 megabits per second (Mbps), with upload speeds between 500 and 800 Mbps. Latency, which measures the delay in data transmission, generally ranged from 10 to 15 milliseconds. These speeds were considered state-of-the-art for home and business internet users before the arrival of next-generation broadband.</p>
            <p>In contrast, the new 10-gigabit (10Gb) broadband technology has pushed those limits even further. Real-world tests recorded download speeds of up to 9,834 Mbps and upload speeds reaching 1,008 Mbps. Latency was also significantly reduced, dropping as low as 3 milliseconds. These results showcase not just incremental upgrades, but a leap in network performance, offering nearly double or more the download speeds, a noticeable boost in upload capacity, and up to three to five times lower latency compared to the best previous broadband services.</p>
